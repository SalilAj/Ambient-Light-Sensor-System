# Ambient-Light-Sensor-System
Considering the 24/7 working culture of Urban Cities all over the world, it has become a priority to make sure that ample visibility is available in every corner of the city. Even though street lights are present on every main road there are always some parts of the city where, due to lack of street lights, the streets and alleys are pitch dark. Such places are prone to crimes and accidents. But identifying such places in a very large city can be a cumbersome manual work. Thus, leveraging the use of the ambient light sensors and GPS technology present in all smart phones we can be able to identify the dark zones of the city using crowd sourcing techniques and map out the places where illumination may be needed.
